Readme for TSCA from PALEON 2018 Sampling
Sylvania wilderness, UP Michigan
GPS Coordinates: 46.24262 N, 89.34400 W
Sample Date: 7/3/18
 
 Major Species present: TSCA--Tsuga Canadensis
 						BEAL--Betula allegheniensis
 						ACSA--Acer saccharum
 						THOC--Thuja occidentalis
 
Note: this plot does not overlap with previous 2012 plot from camp PALEON.
	  To better represent the old-growth forest characteristics for which Sylvania is known,
	  we moved the plot further away from the tower. This increases TSCA and should align better
	  with how Sylvania is being categorized in other PALEON analyses.

TSCA Cores with No Measurements:
	SEH013A
	SEH045A
	SEH073B 

 TSCA Issues:
 TSCA cores are a little unusual due to the tendency for them to break up towards the interior.  
 	Not all rings labeled as missing in the measurements are true locally absent rings. 
 	Some breaks exist that were able to be skipped and keep the core as a single unit.
 	Details on which cores this affects are below.
 	
 	
 	SEH018B--break from 1867-1871
 	SEH026A--break from 1861-1866
 	SEH055A--break from 1831-1832
 	
 * Note that SEH015A1 has lots of missing rings, but these are locally absent rings and not breaks.

BEAL Issues: 
	SEH008A has unusual tree-ring patterns. It does not crossdate well, statistically, but is dated.

			Master series 1891 2018  128 yrs
			Total rings in all series    722
			Total dated rings checked    721

	total ring measurements:	seh_acsa05.rwl
	crossdating statistics:		CHK05COF.OUT

ACSA Issues:
	There are very few ACSA trees in the plot, and this tree species is notoriously difficult to crossdate.
	The cores I have are dated to the best of my ability given the shallow sample depth.
