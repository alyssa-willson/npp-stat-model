Readme for Itasca Wilderness Cores
Itasca Wilderness Scientific and Natural Area, MN
GPS Coordinates: 47.158268, -95.169929
Sample Date: July 29, 2016
Readme created: November 6, 2018

 
Species present: 				PIRE--Pinus resinosa
 						PIST--Pinus strobus
 						ACSA--Acer saccharum
						BEPA--Betual papyrifera
 						
 
Note: This plot is one of two ITASCA plots set up in 2016 ~ 4 weeks before a large windstorm knocked down many of the park's older trees. KH has not been back to see if these trees are still present.

	Cores

PIRE & PIST Files: ITA_final/PIRE_PIST
		
	total ring measurements (1 file):ITApinus.rwl
	crossdating statistics:	ITAPCOF.OUT

Data format:
Formatted in SSST (S = Site ID, T = Tree number). (Each tree we were only permitted to take 1 core, so there is no core number)
-  Example: ITA001 is Itasca Wilderness Plot (ITA), Tree 1 (001)

				


ITA Issues:
 	ITA cores for both PIST and PIRE crossdated reasonably well all together. For this site, we were only permitted to sample 1 core at each tree, so all cores were 	cross dated as a group, and this makes locally absent rings difficult to determine. For some trees we don't have a solid pith date. There is one tree with 		extremely suppressed growth (ITA002) during the last century that has generally low correlations. Some other trees have low statistical correlations with the master 	chronology, but still either highest or very close to the highest correlation as dated.

ACSA, BEPA FILES:

	total ring measurements (1 file):ITAacer.rwl
	crossdating statistics:	ITAACERCOF.OUT


Data format:
Formatted in SSST (S = Site ID, T = Tree number). (Each tree we were only permitted to take 1 core, so there is no core number)
-  Example: ITA001 is Itasca Wilderness Plot (ITA), Tree 1 (001)
                                       

ACSA, BEPA Issues:
	There are very few ACSA, only one BEAL trees in the plot, and given only 1 core per tree, it was difficult to crossdate. We did our best to crossdate these with each 	other, but there are still a few issues. Since these cores are few and generally small trees, these issues are might be okay for the plot level AGB estimates. Issue 	cores include the single BEPA tree in the plot (ITA015), which does not have a high statistical correlation with the ACER cores.




ITA1 Plot level data: ITA_metadata.csv
 	Column names + description:
	Year Cored = year trees were cored in
	Tree = tree number (1 - N, including all trees smaller than 5cm DBH)
	TagID = tag id number (may be different than tree number if plot has small trees)
	Core = total number of cores sampled from each tree (for ITA, this is 1)
	TreeID = Sitename and TagID
	Distance = distance from plot center (meters)
	Azimuth = direction from plot center (degrees 0-360)
	DBH = Diameter at Breast Height (cm)
	Species = Tree Species 
	CW1 = estimated crown width 1 (m): measured from the ground at the widest point
	CW2 = estimated crown width 2 (m): measured from the ground perpendicular to CW1
	TellervoID = ID name as it appears in tellervo output

General ITA Plot level notes:
Plot size: 15m radius plot
Plot site selection: We set the plot set up in an area where the MNDNR and Managers at Itasca State Park indicated there was a mix of both old-growth and secondarygrowth. Plot was nearby, but not directly adjacent to a small swamp area, and a few small blowdowns, but no apparent blowdowns occurred inthe plot.
